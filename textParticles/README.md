## Class and object practice
In this sketch, we created a text character class.
Then use this class, we created an arraylist of a grid of text objects, which will respond to the center of the forceâ€“mouse position. 
The hue of the color as well as the assigned letter will changed based on the distance of each object and the mouse position.
